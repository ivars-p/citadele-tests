Note
---------------
Did not create the last scenario because - I wanted to finish this task in somewhat timely matter, had 
a quick look at it, and it did not look like it would be too difficult to automate. 
Also, an improvement for the whole project could be:
- split the step_definition functionality in class methods
- adding more information to the report on fails
